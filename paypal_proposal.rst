Description

As web platforms continue to grow in relevance, and systems grow in
complexity, the demand for ever-more dependable and introspectable
services follows suit. This talk details the development of Python as
a platform at PayPal, the world's leading online payments processor.

Topics will include a brief history of Python at PayPal, solutions
implemented by the team, and best practice recommendations for service
infrastructure developers. Technical specifics include tackling
high-concurrency, high-performance use cases while grappling with
proprietary legacy systems, and successfully transitioning from an
unreliable, opaque C++ clunker of a runtime to a robust, instrumented,
introspectable, well-oiled almost-entirely-pure-Python machine.

Featuring appearances from such technologies such as coroutines
(gevent), threads (built-in), WSGI (gunicorn), PyOpenSSL (custom
security), and many more, including the unveiling of a couple
open-source libraries that made it all possible.

Audience
--------

Developers interested in:

- What makes software robust and how to foster robustness in their
  services
- Managing high-concurrency deterministically (specifically coroutines
  with gevent)
- Introducing Python to corporate developers with a wide range of
  Python experience (tending toward minimal-to-know experience)

And anyone interested in select tales of intrigue, as told from a
Pythonist's perspective, from within the walls of the black-box
behemoth payments processor otherwise known as PayPal.
