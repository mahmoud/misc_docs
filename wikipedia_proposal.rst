(Going off of the PyCon 2013 Talk List's categories.)

Duration
--------

30 minutes, but expandable to 45 (as detailed below)

Description
-----------

Wikipedia is a pillar of the modern Internet and with hundreds of
thousands of editors is one of largest collaborative texts ever
created. 500 million monthly users know that it is a vast source of
facts, statistics, and media about an ever-increasing number of topics
in an ever-more-complete set of languages.

What's often overlooked is that it also has the most open and
unrestrictive API of any site in its class.

Python is the ideal language for capturing the nuances of Wikipedia's
API and this talk will demonstrate just how easy it can be to tap into
the sum of all human knowledge. From introduction to policies to
patterns and examples


Internet as more than a commercialized wasteland. It's a city with
banks and shops, but where are parks/schools/libraries?

Notes
-----

* This is my first proposal to speak at PyCon, though I have some
  speaking experience:

  - BoF participation at past PyCons
  - Numerous internal tech talks
    - PythonASF: Python ASF Client (2011)
    - Python in the Midtier (2011)
    - Python at PayPal (2012)
    - Python, Wikipedia, and Machine Learning (2012)
    - Service Rationalization with Python (2013)
  - As the main Python evangelist within PayPal, I organized "Python
    Day", which brought together ~300 people from inside and outside
    the company (including Guido and Raymond). I MC'd, gave a
    full-length talk, and did a lightning talk. Video available on
    request.
  - I just did an interview with French TV for Wikipedia-related work,
    if that's relevant.

* Should organizers for some reason want more Wikipedia-related
  content at PyCon, this talk can be extended to be either more
  technical, by focusing more on Wapiti's implementation, or more
  community-centric, by focusing more on contributing.
